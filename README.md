## Setup

git clone https://github.com/Prahaladh39/Shopify-App
cd Shopify-App

2.Install dependencies:

3.Start the development server:
shopify app dev

## Strcuture
You can find the necassary routes inside app/routes
## Persistence

The wishlist data is stored in the browser's localStorage. When a user adds or removes items from the wishlist, those changes are immediately saved to localStorage, ensuring that data persists even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

## One Improvement I'd Make Next

I would add a **search and filter feature** to allow users to quickly find products by name or category. This would make the app more user-friendly, especially as the product list grows.
